                    <div x-show="open" x-collapse>
                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>MC1, or Hub, was the first Arcator server, and was released to the public in December 2010. The server held four different modes, it provided Freebuild, Plots, Peaceful Survival, and Modified Survival.</p>
                        <p>Freebuild allows players to build without restrictions or claiming. Plots allow players to build in specified pieces of land without worrying about griefs. Peaceful Survival gives players a peaceful mode survival experience. Modified Survival is Survival but with some plugins, like Brewery, added to it.</p>
                        
                        <h4>New Spawn</h4>
                        <p>New spawn was created to be a new age spawn for new players. It was later decided that instead of using the new spawn we keep the old spawn because of the many buildings, art and memories that are at the old spawn. You are still teleported to it if you leave peaceful survival or modified survival.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“Where am I?”</blockquote>
                
                        <h4>Peaceful Survival</h4>
                        <p>Peaceful Survival is survival without worrying about monsters, griefing or theft. Fall damage is also disabled. You can play in peace, without worrying about creepers or dying to monsters! Lots of adventures to go on and much to explore! From the many builds and memories that are left by old members who used to play and no longer play on the server.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“So peaceful!”</blockquote>
                                
                        <h4>Sky City</h4>
                        <p>Built in 2013-2014, the server was quiet and hope was dwindling. Built as an attempt to spark up creative energy and get people back into playing on the server, they built Sky City. Hope prevailed as it boosted the servers' activity once again.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“Reminds me of Rome!”</blockquote>
                
                        <h4>Modified Survival</h4>
                        <p>Modified survival is basic survival but it has hostile mobs but no pvp/raiding/griefing! It is a game-mode that contains several plugins that changes survival in various ways! Plus it wouldn't be modified survival without the many plugins! There is much to do, much to do, come have fun in Modified Survival!</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“What is this drink?”</blockquote>
                
                        <h4>Freebuild</h4>
                        <p>You can build whatever with creative freedom in creative in Freebuild! There are many sights to see from the spawn and the many spawn builds to the many towns! You can travel by rail too many old builds and see plenty of cool sights along the way! As someone wise once said, “It's about the friends we make along the way.” From a fully operational nuclear reactor powered by redstone. There are many memories you can make from somber, heartbreaking, too happy! There are countless builds to be made, and plenty old builds to be found!</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote footer">"If you want an adventure of the lifetime, follow the railway!"</blockquote>
                                
                        <h4>Plots</h4>
                        <p>Plots are creative but in a flat environment. You can build to the freedom of your own plot! From houses to landscaping, you have the freedom to create without Minecraft's land generation! Of course sticking to your own plot. You can also explore the many builds left behind.</p>

                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>SSMP or Strawberry SMP. This SMP is a vanilla survival SMP, SMP standing for survival multiplayer. You can meet people, build with people, team with people or go solo. Wars don’t happen. We will be happy to see you on this history rich server.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“Let’s play the SSMP!”</blockquote>
                                
                        <h4>History</h4>
                        <p><strong>THE BEGINNING</strong> It was summer 2019, Arcator was inactive for six months prior. The SSMP was a brighter side of the summer, a true revival something to bring life back into the server. Everyone got together to make the server. People invited friends from other communities. 20 friends got together, many of them not seeing each other in years. Needing a name for the newly founded SMP. A few weeks went by before finally deciding a name Strawberry SMP, and the SSMP was made.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“Strawberries!”</blockquote>
                        <p>The first day of the SSMP you spawn at a piece of land jutting out of the water a cape. On this land was a small village. Some raided the village for supplies, others started building bases around it. Others went sailing out to other places and made their bases on other islands. Some made road systems, others made homes, gardens. The SSMP averaged six people. There was always something to do, people to talk to. They created many cities and kingdoms. Everyone traded supplies peacefully. Everything connected by the nether.</p>
                        <p>As September came, a couple crashes happened, but nothing that killed the server. More people started coming back to spawn to build bases. They paved more roads; they built new land over old. New houses made and public buildings. Villagers were traded with, eventually to the point of max trades. Offering a ton of supplies to everyone who lived at spawn and the people who came to trade at spawn.</p>
                        <p>To protect villagers, walls were constructed. New raids were starting with them came pillagers. Raids happened almost daily from people coming to spawn with bad omen. People came to the village to trade with it more villagers spawning. Everyone got together and donated stone to build walls. It was a team effort to keep the pillagers out. It caused the villager population to skyrocket. Redstone was wired to open and close gates that lead into the village. While the Redstone was being wired, someone found tunnels and underground roadway systems and it was perfect for wiring.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“Creativity inspires those to build”</blockquote>
                        <p>When raids would happen, people would call others for help on the Discord. People would get on and fight off the incoming raid. Some would take a position on roofs, some would melee everyone would fight side by side. People would shout out mobs positions where they were coming from. People would get totems and would hang up the banners from the defeated pillagers. Raids became something of an event and would bring others together.</p>
                        <p>As the population of spawn grew. More crashes came and went. As October came, so did discussion of expansion. Some thought it was a bad idea, others thought it was a good idea, more room for people to build. So the spawn was expanded. With it the raids came, pillagers instead of spawning outside of the walls spawned inside them. Monsters spawned inside the walls, people thought “Maybe if we light everything up it will be better”, “Bring back the inner walls”. Raid after raid, more villagers met the same fate. The iron golems in the city could only fend off so many. People in the city left. Spawn became ran down and eventually no more villagers were there.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“The walls of our city!”</blockquote>
                        <p>Crashes came and went. The city soon became empty. The red stone of the gates stopped working. They tried to repair the gates, but as there were only so many people, things fell into disrepair. The small town returned to its roots. The nether portal remained the heart of the spawn. Once again, the distant bases grew. Then the server crashed, and it took a while to find out that the original SSMP couldn't be repaired. People left and didn't return, others stayed.</p>
                        <p>December 2019 the SSMP returned as a new server. 2020 brought new people and activates for Minecraft and the discord. 2022 and the server is still up and running today.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“Still going…”</blockquote>
                                
                        <h4>The Six Hour War</h4>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“The war no one wanted!”</blockquote>
                        <p>A bunch of people lived together in peace, many cities across the map were all connected. No one wanted war. Everyone tried to avoid war from occurring. Peace remained for a while until people slowly changed. Others tried to back out and show they wanted peace. It did not happen; it kept going. After a battle, the victims tries to take items that were dropped and put them into a chest as a sign of goodwill, but it was too late. A counter attack was already was being planned. War was inevitable. Nobody wanted to lose, so they all tried to strike first. Cites burned and people banded together into teams to fight back against the chaos that rained down upon them.</p>
                                
                        <h4>Locations</h4>
                        <p>This is the Strawberry SMP spawn where you first start in the SMP.</p>

                        <h4>JengaManager</h4>
                        <p>This program has been replaced with RamCheck</p>
                        <p>Located in ~/Services/RamCheck this simplified Python rewrite uses a hard coded 90% threshold and then runs rcon to gradually shutdown more servers.</p>
                        <h5>JengaManager</h5>
                        <p>JengaManager, also known simply as JM, is a systems administration application used to manage processes in the event that system resources become scarce. This process is essential as it ensures that servers do not have to be physically reset when they crash due to a lack of resources (either excess CPU or memory usage), thus maintaining a sufficient uptime so that we may tend to other priorities without the hinderance of machine failure.</p>
                        <p>While JengaManager is written in C++ for the utmost efficiency due to the fact that it is continuously running in the background, these types of processes are referred to as daemons.  Although the portions of the application that run continuously are written in C++, part of JengaManager is written in Perl so that the portions of code relating to reading the configuration file are not so heavily obfuscated especially in the event that one would wish to change the conditions with which JengaManager starts with.</p>
                        <p>To expand upon the ideology that programs used for systems administration should be able to chain together to effectively adapt to novel issues within any system, it is theoretically possible to write scripts to edit the configuration file, so that it may automatically be generated when starting JengaManager.</p>
                        <h5>Editing .config File</h5>
                        <p>To edit the configuration file for JengaManager, the process is as follows:</p>
                        <p>Navigate to JengaManager directory in console:</p>
                        <p>cd ~/JengaManager</p>
                        <p>Open the .config file in a text editor, such as nano:</p>
                        <p>nano .config</p>
                        <p>Now, you should see two lines with the words “src” and “sensitivity”. What do these mean?</p>
                        <p>“src” represents where the process IDs are coming from. The default is set to “pgrep java”, which is a command that returns the processes which run using Java. This allows us to indirectly target the servers (and other Java processes) to be sacrificed in the event that we hit as certain threshold.</p>
                        <p>“sensitivity” is this threshold. By default, it is set to “0.95”, which means we will begin terminating our source processes when either memory or CPU usage reaches 95%. </p>
                        <p>You may edit these lines to fit the needs of the system, to save and exit press CTRL, X, ENTER.</p>
                        <h5>Starting JengaManager</h5>
                        <p>Once you are sure that you have configured the start conditions appropriately, you may move on to starting the program. We want JengaManager to run continuously as it is intended to be a daemon process. Therefore, we will use “tmux” to accomplish this.</p>
                        <p>The process is as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Navigate to the JengaManager directory:</p>
                        <p>cd ~/JengaManager</p>
                        <p>2. Open a new tmux session:</p>
                        <p>tmux new -s JengaManager</p>
                        <p>3. Run JengaManager:</p>
                        <p>./JengaManager</p>
                        <p>If all is well, you may now exit the tmux session by pressing CTRL+B+D simultaneously.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb-4">Checking Logs and the Attaching to the Session</h5>
                        <p>JengaManager provides comprehensive data to a log with each iteration, this data can be extremely useful for diagnosis issues with the behavior of our systems. For instance, if JengaManager is terminating processes continuously, we may have a deeper issue that needs to be remedied. </p>
                        <p>To access these logs:</p>
                        <p>1. Navigate to the JengaManager directory:</p>
                        <p>cd ~/JengaManager</p>
                        <p>2. Print the log:</p>
                        <p>cat JM.log</p>
                        <p>What is display is the time of that iteration started as well as several columns of data. These columns display information the following format:</p>
                        <p>[ Process_X(PID) | Priority | Memory Usage%, CPU Usage% ]</p>
                        <p>This is not the only information provided by the program however, if we attach to the tmux session, we are also provided information about the efficiency of JengaManager as well as how many processes it can see.</p>

                <p>To run, type ./mcbkp.pl in the home directory (cd ~)</p>
                <p>Select a server to load the backup for, options will appear in a list format, enter the number from the list</p>
                <p>Type the name of the person you would like to target for the backup. I.e., X griefed, type in X's name EXACTLY to print their joins to the server.</p>
                <p>Joins are printed in a list just like the servers from step 2, enter the number from the list to specify which join you want to backup the server before.</p>
                <p>You will be prompted on whether you would like to continue or not. This is a CRUCIAL step, pay attention. The point of no return. Make sure you know what you are doing, if you made a mistake you can say n and the process will be terminated (or alternatively CTRL-C).</p>
                <p>Upon entering Y/y, the script will shut down the server and attempt to load a backup via rsync, then it will start the server again. This will open a tmux so you can see if the server successfully started. At this point, if you are sure all is well, you can detach with CTRL-B+D (don't use CTRL-C).</p>

                    <div x-show="open" x-collapse>
                        <h4>Plugin Autoupdater</h4>
                        <p>These scripts auto update plugins for Minecraft. Updates are reported to onfim-log on the Discord channel.</p>
                        <h5>Entry point</h5>
                        <p>On startup, ~/sync/scripts/startup.sh will call ~/sync/scripts/update.sh.</p>
                        <h5>Overview</h5>
                        <p>Scripts will typically add files to ~/plugindb/autospigot or ~/plugindb/spigot. We call these plugin repositories.</p>
                        <p>Server scripts automatically pull jar files from autospigot. But ~/plugindb/spigot must be synced manually with "psync".</p>
                        <p>All scripts will only download if the local last modified and file size are different from the URL.</p>
                        <h5>Scripts in ~/curium/updater/</h5>
                        <p>download_jenkins</p>
                        <p>A single argument --tar to the plugin repository is required. Within it there must be a jenkins.txt with one link per line to an "latestSuccesfulBuild/artifacts Jenkins path OR a Github "releases/latest/download" path. For example</p>
                        <p><a href="https://ci.viaversion.com/job/ViaVersion/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/libs/">https://ci.viaversion.com/job/ViaVersion/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/libs/</a></p>
                        <p><a href="https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/libs/">https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/libs/</a></p>
                        <p>Jar files are crawled and added to the target path if there is an update. This is usually ~/plugindb/autospigot.</p>
                        <p>download_spiget</p>
                        <p>Similarly, download_spiget will read from spiget.csv with a plugin name and spigotmc ID.</p>
                        <p>oget</p>
                        <p>oget accepts two arguments. One link and one local path indicated with -O. It it used to update one file at a time.</p>
                        <p>pruneDb</p>
                        <p>This script accepts one argument to a plugin repository removes any old plugins. (Since the other scripts will not remove duplicates.) Deduplication is done by reading the plugin.yml within each jar and comparing the plugin id and version.</p>
                        <p>psync</p>
                        <p>Common Example: ~/curium/updater/psync.py --src /mnt/Main/shared/spigot/ --tar plugins/</p>
                        <p>psync will automatically sync a --src and target and delete old plugins in the target.</p>
                        <p>-n will start a dry run.</p>
                        <p>-y will auto accept. (Otherwise the user will be prompted).</p>
                        <p>updateServerJar</p>
                        <p>This updates paper to the latest release of the given version. For example</p>
                        <p>~/curium/updater/updateServerJar.py paper 1.20.4 .</p>
                        <p>Servers</p>
                        <p>Servers typically contain an optional <a href="https://blog.update.sh/about-en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">update.sh</a> which is called by <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tmux.sh</a>. This pulls plugins from autospigot and updates the paper jar.</p>

                        <p>This guide is from 2016. It renames survival_pvp to msurvival.</p>
                        <p>First use grep to find all cases of "survival_pvp" in all files. Since MC1's folder contains about 70 GB of files, we'll skip all zips (backups), mca (world files), and log files.</p>
                        <p>grep -r survival_pvp --exclude=\*.{zip,log,mca} --exclude=report.txt MC1 > grep.txt</p>
                        <p>This creates a list of all the files that contain survival_pvp and their path.</p>
                        <p>Now a script was made that looks at all files only in a given folder and non-recursively prompts whether to make the text replacement.</p>
                        <p>The script was run on each directory reported by grep and also blocked zip, log, mca.</p>
                        <p>However, filenames were still not imported and needed to be done manually.</p>
                        <p>In plugins/LogBlock run, the following were renamed.</p>
                        <p>mv survival_pvp_nether.yml msurvival_nether.yml</p>
                        <p>mv survival_pvp.yml msurvival.yml</p>
                        <p>Next, start.sh was given a few edits as it had a simple mirroring system from 2015.</p>
                        <p>Now, check over folders to rename.</p>
                        <p>find MC1 -type d -name "survival_pvp*" -print</p>
                        <p>Rename worlds.</p>
                        <p>mv survival_pvp msurvival</p>
                        <p>mv survival_pvp_nether msurvival_nether</p>
                        <p>mv survival_pvp_the_end msurvival_the_end</p>
                        <p>Similar commands run in backups/worlds and plugins/WorldGuard/worlds.</p>
                        <p>Rename mysql tables and data</p>
                        <p>mysql -u mcsa -p hub</p>
                        <p>RENAME TABLE `lb-survival_pvp` TO `lb-msurvival`;</p>
                        <p>RENAME TABLE `lb-survival_pvp-chest` TO `lb-msurvival-chest`;</p>
                        <p>RENAME TABLE `lb-survival_pvp-sign` TO `lb-msurvival-sign`;</p>
                        <p>RENAME TABLE `lb-survival_pvp_nether` TO `lb-msurvival_nether`;</p>
                        <p>RENAME TABLE `lb-survival_pvp_nether-chest` TO `lb-msurvival_nether-chest`;</p>
                        <p>RENAME TABLE `lb-survival_pvp_nether-sign` TO `lb-msurvival_nether-sign`;</p>
                        <p>Luckily CoreProtect uses only a world id with a single table to link ID to world name, so we replace these world names.</p>
                        <p>UPDATE `co_world` SET world='msurvival' WHERE world='survival_pvp';</p>
                        <p>UPDATE `co_world` SET world='msurvival_nether' WHERE world='survival_pvp_nether';</p>
                        <p>UPDATE `co_world` SET world='msurvival_the_end' WHERE world='survival_pvp_the_end';</p>
                        <p>Now let's rename survivalPVPGroup to msurvivalGroup within MultInv's database.</p>
                        <p>UPDATE `multiinv_multiinv` SET inv_group='msurvivalGroup' WHERE inv_group='survivalPVPGroup';</p>
                        <p>Next, use grep on survivalPVPGroup to see if it stored as a flatfile anywhere in MC1.</p>
                        <p>grep -r survivalPVPGroup --exclude=\*.{zip,log,mca} --exclude=report.txt MC1</p>
                        <p>The output isn't piped into a file unlike the previous example which means it's displayed directly to console.</p>
                        <p>Results show occurences in MultiInv folder, config.yml, groups.yml, logoutworld.yml</p>
                        <p>Next, script was modified to replace survivalPVPGroup with msurvivalGroup in plugins/MultiInv.</p>
                        <p>Server was started up.</p>

                        <p>First use grep to find all cases of "Endspawn" in all files. Use ripgrep to exclude binaries.</p>

                        <p>In ~/sync/scripts/startup.sh we call ~/Services/Argo/tmux.sh sstart</p>
                        <p>This launches a daemon to start the tunnel.</p>
                        <h4>Setup DDNS</h4>
                        <p>Using mcsa copy ~/Services/DDNS from another machine. Change the subdomain in config.json as needed.</p>
                        <h5>DDNS Automation</h5>
                        <p>In ~/sync/scripts/regular.sh we call /home/mcsa/Services/DDNS/start-sync.sh</p>
                        <p>This runs a script when the IP changes. ~/curium/microbrain/notify_ip.py</p>
                        <p>This launches an event for the Onfim network that announces IP change and restarts WireGuard tunnels if necessary.</p>

                        <p>A custom relay service run by curium/mb_poll/main.py listens on Port 2450. Custom code from Velocity and other servers pings the relay which mirrors it to Discord and Matrix.</p>

                        <p>Pro tips:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use journalctl -f to follow logs in real-time after reboot</li>
                            <li>Check journalctl --list-boots to see available boot sessions</li>
                            <li>Look for "segfault," "kernel panic," "Out of memory," or "Hardware Error" messages</li>
                            <li>Pay attention to timestamps right before the crash occurred</li>
                            <li>Start with journalctl -b -1 -p err to get the error messages from your last boot - this usually reveals the smoking gun.</li>

                    <h4>BTRFS Snapshots and Balance Guide</h4>
                    <h5>Basics of Btrfs Send/Receive</h5>
                    <p>Here's a step-by-step guide to understanding btrfs send and receive, focusing on creating efficient incremental backups. This process is perfect for sending backups to another drive or over a network.</p>
                    <p>(Note: All btrfs commands require sudo) We also use btrfs send --proto 2 for more efficiency.</p>
                    <h6>1. Setup: Creating Our Data</h6>
                    <p>First, let's create a workspace and our initial subvolume. A subvolume in Btrfs acts like its own independent directory tree.</p>
                    <p>Bash</p>
                    <pre><code>
                        # Create a test area and move into it
                        mkdir btrfs_test && cd btrfs_test
                        # Create our first subvolume, which will hold our data
                        sudo btrfs subvolume create data_v1
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Now, let's add some data. We'll use two types of files to see how well compression works later.</p>
                    <p>Bash</p>
                    <pre><code>
                        # Create a 200MB file of zeros (highly compressible)
                        sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=data_v1/zeros.bin bs=1M count=200
                        # Create a 200MB file of random data (not compressible)
                        sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=data_v1/random.bin bs=1M count=200
                    </code></pre>
                    <h6>2. The Full Backup (The Base)</h6>
                    <p>To send a subvolume, we first need to create a snapshot. Think of a snapshot as an instantaneous, zero-cost atomic copy of the subvolume's state. For btrfs send, we need a read-only snapshot.</p>
                    <p>Bash</p>
                    <pre><code>
                        # Create a read-only (-r) snapshot of our data
                        sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot -r data_v1 data_v1_ro
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Now, we'll serialize this snapshot into a file stream using btrfs send. We'll also compress it with zstd to save space.</p>
                    <p>Bash</p>
                    <pre><code>
                        # Send the snapshot and compress it
                        sudo btrfs send --proto 2 data_v1_ro | zstd > full_backup.zst
                        # Let's check the size
                        ls -lh full_backup.zst
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>You'll notice the compressed backup is just over 200MB, because the 200MB of zeros compressed to almost nothing, while the random data didn't.</p>
                    <p>💡 To restore this backup, try btrfs receive:</p>
                    <p>We make a destination because btrfs receive will remake the subvolume with the same name. We don't want conflicts.</p>
                    <p>Bash</p>
                     <pre><code>
                        mkdir destination_folder
                        zstdcat full_backup.zst | sudo btrfs receive ./destination_folder
                     </code></pre>
                     <h6>3. The Incremental Backup (The Changes)</h6>
                     <p>An incremental backup only contains the changes since a previous snapshot. This is incredibly efficient. First, let's make some changes to our original data_v1 subvolume.</p>
                     <p>Bash</p>
                     <pre><code>
                        # Add a new, small text file
                        echo "This is a new file." | sudo tee data_v1/new_file.txt > /dev/null
                        # Modify an existing file by appending data
                        echo "More random data" | sudo dd of=data_v1/random.bin bs=1M seek=200 count=1 conv=notrunc
                        # Delete the file of zeros
                        sudo rm data_v1/zeros.bin
                     </code></pre>
                     <p>Now that we've made changes, we create a new read-only snapshot to capture this updated state.</p>
                     <p>Bash</p>
                     <pre><code>
                        sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot -r data_v1 data_v2_ro
                     </code></pre>
                    <p>To create the incremental stream, we tell btrfs send to calculate the difference between the "parent" (-p) snapshot and the new one.</p>

                        # Send ONLY the changes between v1 and v2
                        sudo btrfs send --proto 2 -p data_v1_ro data_v2_ro | zstd > incremental_backup.zst

                    <h6>4. Cleanup</h6>
                    <p>Once you're done, you can delete subvolumes (which includes snapshots) like this.</p>
                    <p>Bash</p>
                    <pre><code>
                        sudo btrfs subvolume delete data_v1 data_v1_ro data_v2_ro
                    </code></pre>
                    <h6>Key Takeaways 📝</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Snapshot First: Always send from a read-only snapshot. Sometimes this means making a temporary subvolume.</li>
                        <li>>Full Backup: The first backup must be a full one, which acts as the base.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>sudo btrfs send &lt;snapshot_name></li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Incremental Backup: Subsequent backups can be incremental by specifying a parent snapshot with the -p flag. This only sends the differences. However btrfs receive will only work if it can recognize the parent exists at the destination.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>sudo btrfs send -p &lt;parent_snapshot> &lt;new_snapshot></li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>The Snapshot Chain: To create an incremental backup from v2 to v3, the v2 snapshot must exist on the source machine. To receive it, the v2 snapshot must exist on the destination. Do not delete intermediate snapshots if you plan to continue a chain of incremental backups. This is the most common point of failure for scripts like btrbk.</li>
                        <li>UUIDs are Key: Btrfs identifies subvolumes by a unique UUID. When you send a snapshot, its UUID is embedded in the stream. btrfs receive looks for a subvolume on the destination with the parent's UUID, not just a matching name. This makes the process very robust. You can see a subvolume's UUID with btrfs subvolume show &lt;path>.</li>
                        <li>Always Compress: Piping the output of btrfs send to a compression tool like zstd is highly recommended to save space.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5ֱ>BTRFS Balance</h5>
                    <h6>1. When to Balance</h6>
                    <p>Consider a balance when the drive is starting to look full (80 - 90% usage).</p>
                    <p>The Signal: Run btrfs filesystem usage /. If Device unallocated is less than 10 GiB or Metadata Size vs Used is less than 10%. It is a good idea.</p>
                    <h6>2. The Simple Commands</h6>
                    <p>Always start small. These commands consolidate "mostly empty" buckets into full ones, freeing up raw space.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Step 1 (Cleanup empty buckets):sudo btrfs balance start -dusage=0 -musage=0 /</li>
                        <li>Step 2 (Cleanup 5% full buckets):sudo btrfs balance start -dusage=5 -musage=5 /</li>
                        <li>Step 3 (Cleanup 10% full buckets): sudo btrfs balance start -dusage=10 -musage=10 /</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Note: -d is for Data (files); -m is for Metadata (file maps).</p>
                    <h6>3. What if it fails? (ENOSPC / Error -2)</h6>
                    <p>If you get a "No space" error while balancing, it means the disk is too crowded to move things around.</p>
                    <p>Go smaller: Use -dusage=1 instead of 10.</p>
                    <p>Delete something: Delete a few large files or old snapshots to give the system breathing room.</p>
                    <p>Try again: Run the Step 1 command above.</p>
                    <h6>4. Why is Metadata so high?</h6>
                    <p>Btrfs grabs large chunks of space for Metadata (your file "map") and doesn't like to give them back. If Metadata Used is 18GB but Metadata Size is 100GB, running the -musage commands above will force Btrfs to shrink that 100GB down and give the space back to your files.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <div x-show="open" x-collapse>
                        <h4>Summary</h4>
                        <p>To prune chunks we first identify all chunks with player activity using CoreProtect. Then we can use mcaselector to delete all chunks which do not match. This is useful when updating servers to the latest version since Minecraft will regenerate the chunks.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector">https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector</a></p>
                        <h4>Steps</h4>
                        <p>We also find chunks by using a prior copy of the chunk list from last prune. (This lets us avoid rereading LogBlock, CoreProtect sqlite3, and other legacy sources for 2010s data.)</p>
                        <p>Instead you will only need to pull data from CoreProtect and run scripts. OLD CHUNK LIST (step 0) + CoreProtect (step 1); merged (step 2) with added radius (step 3) => New Chunk List.</p>
                        <p>We also add a radius of +1 (step 2) to leave safe room away from builds. Since chunk smoothing might modify adjacent chunks. (0 was used before without issue but 1 is a safer estimate so future chunk smoothing doesn't modify any builds.)</p>
                        <p>The final file we write is a list of chunks. We edit the header with a flag to indicate mcaselector should delete everything else.</p>
                        <p>Below is an example with SSMP.</p>
                        <h4>0. Loading the last chunk list</h4>
                        <p>From mcsa@jylina run the following. Adjust commands accordingly.</p>
                        <p>cd ~/sync/scripts/listchunks/ssmp</p>
                        <p>Note there are 3 folders.</p>
                        <p>distinctsources/ (distinct data sources)</p>
                        <p>merged/ (the data from chunks/ merged together)</p>
                        <p>final/ (the total list of chunks from last time)</p>
                        <p>Now we will move the previous final/ and use it as a data source.</p>
                        <p>If final/ already exists and distinctsources/lastprune exists then it's probably an old copy. Run rm -r distinctsources/lastprune</p>
                        <p>Then continue with the move</p>
                        <p>mv final/ distinctsources/lastprune</p>
                        <h4>1. Pulling CoreProtect DB data</h4>
                        <p>To read the mariadb ssmp database and CoreProtect sqlite3 fallback file and output to distinctsources/. Adjust the server name and run the following.</p>
                        <p>python3 ../readco/codb.py ssmp ~/Servers/SSMP/plugins/CoreProtect/database.db distinctsources/</p>
                        <h4>2. Merge the data sources</h4>
                        <p>Now merge all the sources into a single csv file per world (grouping based on filenames.)</p>
                        <p>python3 ../merge.py distinctsources/ merged/</p>
                        <p>Note the new files made in merged/ with ls</p>
                        <h4>3. Creating the delete chunk list.</h4>
                        <p>1 is the radius of chunks to keep. Repeat this command for each world csv in merged/.</p>
                        <p>python3 ../addRadius.py merged/survival.csv 1 final/survival.csv</p>
                        <p>Now manually replace the first line of each csv file in final/ with "inverted"</p>
                        <p>Example</p>
                        <p>inverted</p>
                        <p>-26;12;-826;395</p>
                        <p>...</p>
                        <p>This will reverse the behaviour of mcaselector so that only the chunks that are not in this list will be deleted!</p>
                        <h4>4. The visualizer</h4>
                        <p>This step is optional but can be used to be certain the right chunks are deleted.</p>
                        <p>Inside listchunks/visualize is an example file auditHub.sh which uses mcaselector to create a list of all chunks. There are comments in the file explaining how to use it to make a before and after (step 5) chunk list. Afterwards you can use visualize.py to compare the two (and download the pngs).</p>
                        <h4>5. Using mcaselector</h4>
                        <p>Verify there is a backup of the world. ~/Backups/Snapshot can work but automatically prunes within an hour.</p>
                        <p>Usually the latest version of java is needed.</p>
                        <p>For each file in final/ and corresponding world folder. Run:</p>
                        <p>java -jar mcaselector-2.5.2.jar --mode delete --world ~/Servers/SSMP/survival --selection final/survival.csv</p>
                        <p>Note nether and end use a slightly different --world survival_nether/DIM-1 and --world survival_the_end/DIM1</p>
                        <p>Now check the map size and test it in game. If there is a mistake then revert the map to a backup. For example: rsync -av --checksum --inplace --delete ~/Backups/Snapshot/20250827_1400/SSMP/ ~/Servers/SSMP/</p>
                        <p>You can use the visualizer as well after purging.</p>
                        <h4>6. Optional MariaDB Notes</h4>
                        <p>Each server has a corresponding database. Scripts handle this on their own but these are useful commands if you wish to run custom commands. You should understand SQL databses, tables, and joins to follow this section.</p>
                        <p>To connect to the mariadb console using hub database.</p>
                        <p>mariadb -u root hub</p>
                        <p>To list all databases (within the mariadb console)</p>
                        <p>show databases;</p>
                        <p>To change databases (within the mariadb console)</p>
                        <p>use hub;</p>
                        <p>At this point SELECT statements are used. SELECT statements are safe because they do not modify tables.</p>
                        <p>Logical Breakdown of codb.py query</p>
                        <p>The select statement can be found in readco/const.py.</p>
                        <p>It converts the xz coordinates into chunk coordinates. The count parameter is not used but stores the number of block changes in a block.</p>
                        <p>The co_block table stores all block changes.</p>
                        <p>The where clause checks for all block edits besides a black list of natural blocks. This list would be improved.</p>
                        <p>The check co_user.uuid is not null filters out all non-users such as lava and entity changes.</p>
                        <p>co_block.wid is HARD CODED for the proper id.</p>
                        <p>Finding the wid</p>
                        <p>select * from co_world;</p>
                        <p>Simplified Pruning</p>
                        <p>A good heuristic is to use the InhabitedTime (measured in ticks, a twentieth of a second).</p>
                        <p>Here's an example of commmands</p>
                        <p>java -jar ~/mcaselector-2.6.1.jar --query "InhabitedTime < 5000" --world world --mode delete</p>
                        <p>java -jar ~/mcaselector-2.6.1.jar --query "InhabitedTime < 5000" --world world_nether/DIM-1 --mode delete</p>
                        <p>java -jar ~/mcaselector-2.6.1.jar --query "InhabitedTime < 5000" --world world_the_end/DIM1 --mode delete</p>

                        <h4>Server Selector</h4>
                        <p>Completely recreate the server selector plugin on Hub</p>
                        <p>New features:</p>
                        <p>Players can toggle if they receive one. Removes servers that are offline from the GUI. Label the server selector with an NBT tag (NBTTagEditor), so if the item’s name, material, etc. ever changes, the old ones can be wiped+replaced</p>
                        <p>Current bugs:</p>
                        <p>Duplicates in inventory sometime. Make GUI editing easier + version compatible with XSeries</p>

                        <p>Hub and SSMP use a custom height datapack. We lost the original generator so for each server update we get find a new expanded height datapack. Then we set the min Y to -64 and the max height accordingly using the old one as reference. Then we confirm no other flags changed.</p>
