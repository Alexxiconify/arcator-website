                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>MC1, or Hub, was the first Arcator server, and was released to the public in December 2010. The server held four different modes, it provided Freebuild, Plots, Peaceful Survival, and Modified Survival.</p>
                <p>Freebuild allows players to build without restrictions or claiming. Plots allow players to build in specified pieces of land without worrying about griefs. Peaceful Survival gives players a peaceful mode survival experience. Modified Survival is Survival but with some plugins, like Brewery, added to it.</p>

                <h4>New Spawn</h4>
                <p>New spawn was created to be a new age spawn for new players. It was later decided that instead of using the new spawn we keep the old spawn because of the many buildings, art and memories that are at the old spawn. You are still teleported to it if you leave peaceful survival or modified survival.</p>

                <hr class="my-4">
                
                <h4>Peaceful Survival</h4>
                <p>Peaceful Survival is survival without worrying about monsters, griefing or theft. Fall damage is also disabled. You can play in peace, without worrying about creepers or dying to monsters! Lots of adventures to go on and much to explore! From the many builds and memories that are left by old members who used to play and no longer play on the server.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“So peaceful!”</blockquote>

                <h4>Sky City</h4>
                <p>Built in 2013-2014, the server was quiet and hope was dwindling. Built as an attempt to spark up creative energy and get people back into playing on the server, they built Sky City. Hope prevailed as it boosted the servers' activity once again.</p>

                <h4>Modified Survival</h4>
                <p>Modified survival is basic survival but it has hostile mobs but no pvp/raiding/griefing! It is a game-mode that contains several plugins that changes survival in various ways! Plus it wouldn't be modified survival without the many plugins! There is much to do, much to do, come have fun in Modified Survival!</p>

                <h4>Freebuild</h4>
                <p>You can build whatever with creative freedom in creative in Freebuild! There are many sights to see from the spawn and the many spawn builds to the many towns! You can travel by rail too many old builds and see plenty of cool sights along the way! As someone wise once said, “It's about the friends we make along the way.” From a fully operational nuclear reactor powered by redstone. There are many memories you can make from somber, heartbreaking, too happy! There are countless builds to be made, and plenty old builds to be found!</p>

                <h4>Plots</h4>
                <p>Plots are creative but in a flat environment. You can build to the freedom of your own plot! From houses to landscaping, you have the freedom to create without Minecraft's land generation! Of course sticking to your own plot. You can also explore the many builds left behind.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-4">SSMP (Strawberry SMP)</h2>
                
                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>SSMP or Strawberry SMP. This SMP is a vanilla survival SMP, SMP standing for survival multiplayer. You can meet people, build with people, team with people or go solo. Wars don’t happen. We will be happy to see you on this history rich server.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“Let’s play the SSMP!”</blockquote>
                
                <hr class="my-4">
                
                <h4>History</h4>
                <p><strong>THE BEGINNING</strong> It was summer 2019, Arcator was inactive for six months prior. The SSMP was a brighter side of the summer, a true revival something to bring life back into the server. Everyone got together to make the server. People invited friends from other communities. 20 friends got together, many of them not seeing each other in years. Needing a name for the newly founded SMP. A few weeks went by before finally deciding a name Strawberry SMP, and the SSMP was made.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“Strawberries!”</blockquote>
                <p>The first day of the SSMP you spawn at a piece of land jutting out of the water a cape. On this land was a small village. Some raided the village for supplies, others started building bases around it. Others went sailing out to other places and made their bases on other islands. Some made road systems, others made homes, gardens. The SSMP averaged six people. There was always something to do, people to talk to. They created many cities and kingdoms. Everyone traded supplies peacefully. Everything connected by the nether.</p>
                <p>As September came, a couple crashes happened, but nothing that killed the server. More people started coming back to spawn to build bases. They paved more roads; they built new land over old. New houses made and public buildings. Villagers were traded with, eventually to the point of max trades. Offering a ton of supplies to everyone who lived at spawn and the people who came to trade at spawn.</p>
                <p>To protect villagers, walls were constructed. New raids were starting with them came pillagers. Raids happened almost daily from people coming to spawn with bad omen. People came to the village to trade with it more villagers spawning. Everyone got together and donated stone to build walls. It was a team effort to keep the pillagers out. It caused the villager population to skyrocket. Redstone was wired to open and close gates that lead into the village. While the Redstone was being wired, someone found tunnels and underground roadway systems and it was perfect for wiring.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“Creativity inspires those to build”</blockquote>
                <p>When raids would happen, people would call others for help on the Discord. People would get on and fight off the incoming raid. Some would take a position on roofs, some would melee everyone would fight side by side. People would shout out mobs positions where they were coming from. People would get totems and would hang up the banners from the defeated pillagers. Raids became something of an event and would bring others together.</p>
                <p>As the population of spawn grew. More crashes came and went. As October came, so did discussion of expansion. Some thought it was a bad idea, others thought it was a good idea, more room for people to build. So the spawn was expanded. With it the raids came, pillagers instead of spawning outside of the walls spawned inside them. Monsters spawned inside the walls, people thought “Maybe if we light everything up it will be better”, “Bring back the inner walls”. Raid after raid, more villagers met the same fate. The iron golems in the city could only fend off so many. People in the city left. Spawn became ran down and eventually no more villagers were there.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“The walls of our city!”</blockquote>
                <p>Crashes came and went. The city soon became empty. The red stone of the gates stopped working. They tried to repair the gates, but as there were only so many people, things fell into disrepair. The small town returned to its roots. The nether portal remained the heart of the spawn. Once again, the distant bases grew. Then the server crashed, and it took a while to find out that the original SSMP couldn't be repaired. People left and didn't return, others stayed.</p>
                <p>December 2019 the SSMP returned as a new server. 2020 brought new people and activates for Minecraft and the discord. 2022 and the server is still up and running today.</p>

                <h4>The Six Hour War</h4>
                <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“The war no one wanted!”</blockquote>
                <p>A bunch of people lived together in peace, many cities across the map were all connected. No one wanted war. Everyone tried to avoid war from occurring. Peace remained for a while until people slowly changed. Others tried to back out and show they wanted peace. It did not happen; it kept going. After a battle, the victims tries to take items that were dropped and put them into a chest as a sign of goodwill, but it was too late. A counter attack was already was being planned. War was inevitable. Nobody wanted to lose, so they all tried to strike first. Cites burned and people banded together into teams to fight back against the chaos that rained down upon them.</p>
