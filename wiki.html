                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>MC1, or Hub, was the first Arcator server, and was released to the public in December 2010. The server held four different modes, it provided Freebuild, Plots, Peaceful Survival, and Modified Survival.</p>
                <p>Freebuild allows players to build without restrictions or claiming. Plots allow players to build in specified pieces of land without worrying about griefs. Peaceful Survival gives players a peaceful mode survival experience. Modified Survival is Survival but with some plugins, like Brewery, added to it.</p>

                <h4>New Spawn</h4>
                <p>New spawn was created to be a new age spawn for new players. It was later decided that instead of using the new spawn we keep the old spawn because of the many buildings, art and memories that are at the old spawn. You are still teleported to it if you leave peaceful survival or modified survival.</p>

                <hr class="my-4">
                
                <h4>Peaceful Survival</h4>
                <p>Peaceful Survival is survival without worrying about monsters, griefing or theft. Fall damage is also disabled. You can play in peace, without worrying about creepers or dying to monsters! Lots of adventures to go on and much to explore! From the many builds and memories that are left by old members who used to play and no longer play on the server.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“So peaceful!”</blockquote>

                <h4>Sky City</h4>
                <p>Built in 2013-2014, the server was quiet and hope was dwindling. Built as an attempt to spark up creative energy and get people back into playing on the server, they built Sky City. Hope prevailed as it boosted the servers' activity once again.</p>

                <h4>Modified Survival</h4>
                <p>Modified survival is basic survival but it has hostile mobs but no pvp/raiding/griefing! It is a game-mode that contains several plugins that changes survival in various ways! Plus it wouldn't be modified survival without the many plugins! There is much to do, much to do, come have fun in Modified Survival!</p>

                <h4>Freebuild</h4>
                <p>You can build whatever with creative freedom in creative in Freebuild! There are many sights to see from the spawn and the many spawn builds to the many towns! You can travel by rail too many old builds and see plenty of cool sights along the way! As someone wise once said, “It's about the friends we make along the way.” From a fully operational nuclear reactor powered by redstone. There are many memories you can make from somber, heartbreaking, too happy! There are countless builds to be made, and plenty old builds to be found!</p>

                <h4>Plots</h4>
                <p>Plots are creative but in a flat environment. You can build to the freedom of your own plot! From houses to landscaping, you have the freedom to create without Minecraft's land generation! Of course sticking to your own plot. You can also explore the many builds left behind.</p>

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>SSMP or Strawberry SMP. This SMP is a vanilla survival SMP, SMP standing for survival multiplayer. You can meet people, build with people, team with people or go solo. Wars don’t happen. We will be happy to see you on this history rich server.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“Let’s play the SSMP!”</blockquote>
                
                <hr class="my-4">
                
                <h4>History</h4>
                <p><strong>THE BEGINNING</strong> It was summer 2019, Arcator was inactive for six months prior. The SSMP was a brighter side of the summer, a true revival something to bring life back into the server. Everyone got together to make the server. People invited friends from other communities. 20 friends got together, many of them not seeing each other in years. Needing a name for the newly founded SMP. A few weeks went by before finally deciding a name Strawberry SMP, and the SSMP was made.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“Strawberries!”</blockquote>
                <p>The first day of the SSMP you spawn at a piece of land jutting out of the water a cape. On this land was a small village. Some raided the village for supplies, others started building bases around it. Others went sailing out to other places and made their bases on other islands. Some made road systems, others made homes, gardens. The SSMP averaged six people. There was always something to do, people to talk to. They created many cities and kingdoms. Everyone traded supplies peacefully. Everything connected by the nether.</p>
                <p>As September came, a couple crashes happened, but nothing that killed the server. More people started coming back to spawn to build bases. They paved more roads; they built new land over old. New houses made and public buildings. Villagers were traded with, eventually to the point of max trades. Offering a ton of supplies to everyone who lived at spawn and the people who came to trade at spawn.</p>
                <p>To protect villagers, walls were constructed. New raids were starting with them came pillagers. Raids happened almost daily from people coming to spawn with bad omen. People came to the village to trade with it more villagers spawning. Everyone got together and donated stone to build walls. It was a team effort to keep the pillagers out. It caused the villager population to skyrocket. Redstone was wired to open and close gates that lead into the village. While the Redstone was being wired, someone found tunnels and underground roadway systems and it was perfect for wiring.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“Creativity inspires those to build”</blockquote>
                <p>When raids would happen, people would call others for help on the Discord. People would get on and fight off the incoming raid. Some would take a position on roofs, some would melee everyone would fight side by side. People would shout out mobs positions where they were coming from. People would get totems and would hang up the banners from the defeated pillagers. Raids became something of an event and would bring others together.</p>
                <p>As the population of spawn grew. More crashes came and went. As October came, so did discussion of expansion. Some thought it was a bad idea, others thought it was a good idea, more room for people to build. So the spawn was expanded. With it the raids came, pillagers instead of spawning outside of the walls spawned inside them. Monsters spawned inside the walls, people thought “Maybe if we light everything up it will be better”, “Bring back the inner walls”. Raid after raid, more villagers met the same fate. The iron golems in the city could only fend off so many. People in the city left. Spawn became ran down and eventually no more villagers were there.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“The walls of our city!”</blockquote>
                <p>Crashes came and went. The city soon became empty. The red stone of the gates stopped working. They tried to repair the gates, but as there were only so many people, things fell into disrepair. The small town returned to its roots. The nether portal remained the heart of the spawn. Once again, the distant bases grew. Then the server crashed, and it took a while to find out that the original SSMP couldn't be repaired. People left and didn't return, others stayed.</p>
                <p>December 2019 the SSMP returned as a new server. 2020 brought new people and activates for Minecraft and the discord. 2022 and the server is still up and running today.</p>

                <h4>The Six Hour War</h4>
                <blockquote class="blockquote footer">“The war no one wanted!”</blockquote>
                <p>A bunch of people lived together in peace, many cities across the map were all connected. No one wanted war. Everyone tried to avoid war from occurring. Peace remained for a while until people slowly changed. Others tried to back out and show they wanted peace. It did not happen; it kept going. After a battle, the victims tries to take items that were dropped and put them into a chest as a sign of goodwill, but it was too late. A counter attack was already was being planned. War was inevitable. Nobody wanted to lose, so they all tried to strike first. Cites burned and people banded together into teams to fight back against the chaos that rained down upon them.</p>

                <h3 class="mb-4">Tools</h3>
                <h4 class="mb-4">JengaManager</h4>
                <p>This program has been replaced with RamCheck</p>
                <p>Located in ~/Services/RamCheck this simplified Python rewrite uses a hard coded 90% threshold and then runs rcon to gradually shutdown more servers.</p>
                <h5 class="mb-4">JengaManager</h4>
                <p>JengaManager, also known simply as JM, is a systems administration application used to manage processes in the event that system resources become scarce. This process is essential as it ensures that servers do not have to be physically reset when they crash due to a lack of resources (either excess CPU or memory usage), thus maintaining a sufficient uptime so that we may tend to other priorities without the hinderance of machine failure.</p>
                <p>While JengaManager is written in C++ for the utmost efficiency due to the fact that it is continuously running in the background, these types of processes are referred to as daemons.  Although the portions of the application that run continuously are written in C++, part of JengaManager is written in Perl so that the portions of code relating to reading the configuration file are not so heavily obfuscated especially in the event that one would wish to change the conditions with which JengaManager starts with.</p>
                <p>To expand upon the ideology that programs used for systems administration should be able to chain together to effectively adapt to novel issues within any system, it is theoretically possible to write scripts to edit the configuration file, so that it may automatically be generated when starting JengaManager.</p>
                <h5 class="mb-4">Editing .config File</h5>
                <p>To edit the configuration file for JengaManager, the process is as follows:</p>
                <p>Navigate to JengaManager directory in console:</p>
                <p>cd ~/JengaManager</p>
                <p>Open the .config file in a text editor, such as nano:</p>
                <p>nano .config</p>
                <p>Now, you should see two lines with the words “src” and “sensitivity”. What do these mean?</p>
                <p>“src” represents where the process IDs are coming from. The default is set to “pgrep java”, which is a command that returns the processes which run using Java. This allows us to indirectly target the servers (and other Java processes) to be sacrificed in the event that we hit as certain threshold.</p>
                <p>“sensitivity” is this threshold. By default, it is set to “0.95”, which means we will begin terminating our source processes when either memory or CPU usage reaches 95%. </p>
                <p>You may edit these lines to fit the needs of the system, to save and exit press CTRL, X, ENTER.</p>
                <h5 class="mb-4">Starting JengaManager</h5>
                <p>Once you are sure that you have configured the start conditions appropriately, you may move on to starting the program. We want JengaManager to run continuously as it is intended to be a daemon process. Therefore, we will use “tmux” to accomplish this.</p>
                <p>The process is as follows:</p>
                <p>1. Navigate to the JengaManager directory:</p>
                <p>cd ~/JengaManager</p>
                <p>2. Open a new tmux session:</p>
                <p>tmux new -s JengaManager</p>
                <p>3. Run JengaManager:</p>
                <p>./JengaManager</p>
                <p>If all is well, you may now exit the tmux session by pressing CTRL+B+D simultaneously.</p>
                <h5 class="mb-4">Checking Logs and the Attaching to the Session</h5>
                <p>JengaManager provides comprehensive data to a log with each iteration, this data can be extremely useful for diagnosis issues with the behavior of our systems. For instance, if JengaManager is terminating processes continuously, we may have a deeper issue that needs to be remedied. </p>
                <p>To access these logs:</p>
                <p>1. Navigate to the JengaManager directory:</p>
                <p>cd ~/JengaManager</p>
                <p>2. Print the log:</p>
                <p>cat JM.log</p>
                <p>What is display is the time of that iteration started as well as several columns of data. These columns display information the following format:</p>
                <p>[ Process_X(PID) | Priority | Memory Usage%, CPU Usage% ]</p>
                <p>This is not the only information provided by the program however, if we attach to the tmux session, we are also provided information about the efficiency of JengaManager as well as how many processes it can see.</p>
                <p>To attach to the session:</p>
                <p>tmux a -t JengaManager</p>
                <p>Once again, to exit the tmux session you press CTRL+B+D simultaneously.</p>
                <h4 class="mb-4">MC Backup</h4>
                <p>Warning. This program hasn't been used since 2022.</p>
                <p>To run, type ./mcbkp.pl in the home directory (cd ~)</p>
                <p>Select a server to load the backup for, options will appear in a list format, enter the number from the list</p>
                <p>Type the name of the person you would like to target for the backup. I.e., X griefed, type in X's name EXACTLY to print their joins to the server.</p>
                <p>Joins are printed in a list just like the servers from step 2, enter the number from the list to specify which join you want to backup the server before.</p>
                <p>You will be prompted on whether you would like to continue or not. This is a CRUCIAL step, pay attention. The point of no return. Make sure you know what you are doing, if you made a mistake you can say n and the process will be terminated (or alternatively CTRL-C).</p>
                <p>Upon entering Y/y, the script will shut down the server and attempt to load a backup via rsync, then it will start the server again. This will open a tmux so you can see if the server successfully started. At this point, if you are sure all is well, you can detach with CTRL-B+D (don't use CTRL-C).</p>
                <h3>Onfim Auto Updater</h3>
                <h4>Plugin Autoupdater</h4>
                <p>These scripts auto update plugins for Minecraft. Updates are reported to onfim-log on the Discord channel.</p>
                <h5>Entry point</h5>
                <p>On startup, ~/sync/scripts/startup.sh will call ~/sync/scripts/update.sh.</p>
                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>Scripts will typically add files to ~/plugindb/autospigot or ~/plugindb/spigot. We call these plugin repositories.</p>
                <p>Server scripts automatically pull jar files from autospigot. But ~/plugindb/spigot must be synced manually with "psync".</p>
                <p>All scripts will only download if the local last modified and file size are different from the URL.</p>
                <h5>Scripts in ~/curium/updater/</h5>
                <p>download_jenkins</p>
                <p>A single argument --tar to the plugin repository is required. Within it there must be a jenkins.txt with one link per line to an "latestSuccesfulBuild/artifacts Jenkins path OR a Github "releases/latest/download" path. For example</p>
                <p>https://ci.viaversion.com/job/ViaVersion/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/libs/</p>
                <p>https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/libs/</p>
                <p>Jar files are crawled and added to the target path if there is an update. This is usually ~/plugindb/autospigot.</p>
                <p>download_spiget</p>
                <p>Similarly, download_spiget will read from spiget.csv with a plugin name and spigotmc ID.</p>
                <p>oget</p>
                <p>oget accepts two arguments. One link and one local path indicated with -O. It it used to update one file at a time.</p>
                <p>pruneDb</p>
                <p>This script accepts one argument to a plugin repository removes any old plugins. (Since the other scripts will not remove duplicates.) Deduplication is done by reading the plugin.yml within each jar and comparing the plugin id and version.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-4">Rename Hub World (Old)</h4>
                <p>This guide is from 2016. It renames survival_pvp to msurvival. First use grep to find all cases of "survival_pvp" in all files. Since MC1's folder contains about 70 GB of files, we'll skip all zips (backups), mca (world files), and log files. grep -r survival_pvp --exclude=\*.{zip,log,mca} --exclude=report.txt MC1 > grep.txt This creates a list of all the files that contain survival_pvp and their path. Now a script was made that looks at all files only in a given folder and non-recursively prompts whether to make the text replacement. The script was run on each directory reported by grep and also blocked zip, log, mca. However, filenames were still not imported and needed to be done manually. In plugins/LogBlock run, the following were renamed. mv survival_pvp_nether.yml msurvival_nether.yml mv survival_pvp.yml msurvival.yml Next, start.sh was given a few edits as it had a simple mirroring system from 2015. Now, check over folders to rename. find MC1 -type d -name "survival_pvp*" -print Rename worlds. mv survival_pvp msurvival mv survival_pvp_nether msurvival_nether mv survival_pvp_the_end msurvival_the_end Similar commands run in backups/worlds and plugins/WorldGuard/worlds. Rename mysql tables and data mysql -u mcsa -p hub RENAME TABLE `lb-survival_pvp` TO `lb-msurvival`; RENAME TABLE `lb-survival_pvp-chest` TO `lb-msurvival-chest`; RENAME TABLE `lb-survival_pvp-sign` TO `lb-msurvival-sign`; RENAME TABLE `lb-survival_pvp_nether` TO `lb-msurvival_nether`; RENAME TABLE `lb-survival_pvp_nether-chest` TO `lb-msurvival_nether-chest`; RENAME TABLE `lb-survival_pvp_nether-sign` TO `lb-msurvival_nether-sign`; Luckily CoreProtect uses only a world id with a single table to link ID to world name, so we replace these world names. UPDATE `co_world` SET world='msurvival' WHERE world='survival_pvp'; UPDATE `co_world` SET world='msurvival_nether' WHERE world='survival_pvp_nether'; UPDATE `co_world` SET world='msurvival_the_end' WHERE world='survival_pvp_the_end'; Now let's rename survivalPVPGroup to msurvivalGroup within MultInv's database. UPDATE `multiinv_multiinv` SET inv_group='msurvivalGroup' WHERE inv_group='survivalPVPGroup'; Next, use grep on survivalPVPGroup to see if it stored as a flatfile anywhere in MC1. grep -r survivalPVPGroup --exclude=\*.{zip,log,mca} --exclude=report.txt MC1 The output isn't piped into a file unlike the previous example which means it's displayed directly to console. Results show occurences in MultiInv folder, config.yml, groups.yml, logoutworld.yml Next, script was modified to replace survivalPVPGroup with msurvivalGroup in plugins/MultiInv. Server was started up.</p>
                <h4 class="mt-4">Rename Hub World 2023</h4>
                <p>This guide is from 2023. It renames Endspawn to creative the end First use grep to find all cases of "Endspawn" in all files. Use ripgrep to exclude binaries. rg -l Endspawn This creates a list of all the files that contain Endspawn and their path. Now we find replace text. rg -l Endspawn | xargs sed -i ‘s|Endspawn|creativetheend|g’ However, filenames were still not imported and needed to be done manually. First find them: fd Endspawn Example in plugins/LogBlock run, the following were renamed. mv Endspawn.yml creaitve the end.yml Next, start.sh was given a few edits as it had a simple mirroring system from 2015. Rename mysql tables and data mysql -u mcsa -p hub rename table `lb-Endspawn` to `lb-creative_the_end`; rename table `lb-Endspawn-blocks` to `lb-creative_the_end-blocks`; rename table `lb-Endspawn-chest` to `lb-creative_the_end-chest`; rename table `lb-Endspawn-chestdata` to `lb-creative_the_end-chestdata`; rename table `lb-Endspawn-entities` to `lb-creative_the_end-entities`; rename table `lb-Endspawn-entityids` to `lb-creative_the_end-entityids`; rename table `lb-Endspawn-sign` to `lb-creative_the_end-sign`; rename table `lb-Endspawn-state` to `lb-creative_the_end-state`; Luckily CoreProtect uses only a world id with a single table to link ID to world name, so we replace these world names. UPDATE `co_world` SET world='msurvival' WHERE world='survival_pvp'; UPDATE `co_world` SET world='msurvival_nether' WHERE world='survival_pvp_nether'; UPDATE `co_world` SET world='msurvival_the_end' WHERE world='survival_pvp_the_end'; Remember to do the same for plugins/CoreProtect/database.db Server was started up.</p>
                <h4 class="mt-4">Rename User by UUID</h4>
                <p>It's much better to rename a user before they log in with their new account so an Old → New can be done rather than a 3 way switch Old ←> New which requires an intermediate UUID. Required dnf install rename Strongly recommended to use the script ~/sync/scripts/rename_uuid.sh which does safety checks Update the CoreProtect and LuckPerms database For co user and luckperms players run these. update co_user/luckperms_players set uuid='069a79f4-44e9-4726-a5be-fca90e38aaf5' where uuid='09ec192c-4abe-48da-892d-d13639817bc5'; update luckperms_user_permissions set uuid='a12b4ad1-d5b8-4dae-bb4e-4e6b03f3fba8' where uuid='00000000-0000-0000-0009-01fd6b3640fa'; Hub PlotsSquared storage.db sqlite3 storage.db update plot set owner='864cff60-0b54-4757-a1f3-f7d4828b7d29' where owner='d85338cf-bbf5-4ae0-9a53-62194b765754'; Update the CoreProtect database MySQL > show databases\g; Save results in Python a = '''acc               bedwars           bentobox           captive   ...'''

                <h4 class="mt-4">Rename World</h4>
                <p>In this example we use farlands to rename world to legacy and world_nether to legacy_nether.CoreProtect. 1. mysql -u farlands -p farlands 2. View: SELECT * FROM co_world; 3. UPDATE co_world SET world='legacy' WHERE rowid=1; 4. UPDATE co_world SET world='legacy_nether' WHERE rowid=3; PerWorldInv: use text replacement, sed -i 's|"world":"world|"world":"legacy|g' */last*.
